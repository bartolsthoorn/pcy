# Pcy
Tiny Clojure REPL script written in Clojure. Currently only has minimal color support, and only usable for one-liners. Inspired by Ruby's [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry).

## Use
Make sure you have [lein exec](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-exec) installed to run this Clojure script.
```bash
lein exec pcy.clj
# Wait for it to load and then test it: [1 2 3]
```
